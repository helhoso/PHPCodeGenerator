IMPORTANT
    The archive of origen is necessary to have a .sql generated by MySQL with tags:
    "TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" for get the name of table
    " ENGINE=" for to know the end of the table
     "PRIMARY KEY" to finish loop of read coluns of table

	All classes are made in a sigle file
	I tip you to separat after that class by class

	After the file made generated, change the extension to .php 
	Example.: "class Empoyer" => "empoyer.php"
